        <h2> Let me explain that I still don’t know my exact graduation path. 
            Therefore, my journey may seem a bit broad, but I am interested in finding out 
            what I really want to do in university and in the future. However, since I already like computer systems, 
            I am confident that I have the skills and interest to study them, and I have the opportunity to develop 
            the knowledge and skills needed for the future. My main goal is to graduate with good knowledge and grades, 
            in order to prepare myself to confidently enter the working world.</h2>
